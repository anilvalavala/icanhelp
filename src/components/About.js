        <div>
            <h1>What is this about?</h1>
            <br />
            <p>
                Yes, today the world is full of sophisticated computers, machines, devices, food, what not, everything. <br />
                But still there are a section of people who are looking for help. <br /><br />
                There are many people who want to extend their helping hand to the society <br />
                But there is no bridge connecting such kind hearted people to the needy ones. <br /> <br />

                So, this application is intended for those people who want to donate something. <br />
                One can simply update their donation details and everyone on web can see it,  
                especially NGOs which are working for upliftment of less privileged. <br />

                This is just a basic verion of my idea. 
                Will keep updating this app to make it more user friendly.
